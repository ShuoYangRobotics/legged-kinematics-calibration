The interacting multiple model algorithm for systems with Markovian switching coefficients

Use IMM to generate leg velocity estimation


rosbag_process      -  load ROS bag data, perform data filtering as well
compare_velocities  -  compare mocap velocity and leg velocities
imm_run             -  use IMM to combine leg velocites
baseline1_run        -  use contact flag to combine leg velocities
baseline2_run        -  use contact flag & variance as a weight function to combine leg velocities


TODO: add dynamic foot force threshold
